# Spec Writing Standard

This file defines canonical structure for branch markdown files so multiple AI tools behave consistently.

Branch files are runtime memory under `.spec-driven/<sanitized-current-branch>/`.

## General Writing Rules

1. Prefer explicit structured sections over freeform prose.
2. Separate confirmed facts from assumptions and open questions.
3. If information is unknown, write `Unknown` rather than inventing details.
4. If section is not applicable, write `Not applicable`.
5. Update existing structure in place unless change-log style is explicitly needed.
6. Keep files truthful to current branch state.

## Cross-File Section Schema

For consistency and reuse, every stage or appendix file should contain the sections below when relevant:

- Purpose
- Inputs
- Constraints
- Decisions
- Open questions
- Out of scope
- Dependencies
- Status

Stage-specific required sections below remain mandatory even if this schema is adapted.

## `00-current-status.md` Standard

Required fields:

- Current branch
- Current stage
- Completed steps
- Incompleted stages
- Next recommended step
- Status note
- Blockers / warnings
- Last updated by
- Last updated at
